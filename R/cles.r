#' cles
#'
#' This function calculates a permutation test version of the common language effect size. Unlike McGraw & Wong's original method, which used an algebraic/normal approximation, this version makes no assumptions about the distribution of the data.
#' Each X observation is paired to each Y observation. The proportion of XY pairs where X is higher than Y is then computed and output. Ties count as 0.5*TRUE.
